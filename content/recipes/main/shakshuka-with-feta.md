title: Shakshuka With Feta
description: Shakshuka may be at the apex of eggs-for-dinner recipes, though in
  Israel it is breakfast food, a bright, spicy start to the day with a pile of
  pita or challah served on the side (It also makes excellent brunch or lunch
  food.) It’s a one-skillet recipe of eggs baked in a tomato-red pepper sauce
  spiced with cumin, paprika and cayenne First you make that sauce, which comes
  together fairly quickly on top of the stove, then you gently crack each of the
  eggs into the pan, nestling them into the sauce

## INGREDIENTS

* 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 large onion, halved and thinly sliced
* 1 large red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
* 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon sweet paprika
* ⅛ teaspoon ground cayenne, or to taste
* 1 (28-ounce) can whole plum tomatoes with their juices, coarsely chopped
* ¾ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed
* ¼ teaspoon black pepper, plus more as needed
* 5 ounces feta, crumbled (about 1 1/4 cups)
* 6 large eggs
* Chopped cilantro, for serving
* Hot sauce, for serving

## PREPARATION

1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low. Add onion and bell pepper. Cook gently until very soft, about 20 minutes. Add garlic and cook until tender, 1 to 2 minutes; stir in cumin, paprika and cayenne, and cook 1 minute. Pour in tomatoes and season with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; simmer until tomatoes have thickened, about 10 minutes. Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed. Stir in crumbled feta.
2. Gently crack eggs into skillet over tomatoes. Season eggs with salt and pepper. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until eggs are just set, 7 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve with hot sauce.

## Notes

We love this recipe! Be careful not to stir in the feta. If you stir too much, it will mix in with the sauce. You want the feta to sit and cook into little lumps of joy.
