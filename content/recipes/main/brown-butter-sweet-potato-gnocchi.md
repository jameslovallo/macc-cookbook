## INGREDIENTS:

- 2 medium sweet potatoes
- 1/2 cup whole milk ricotta
- 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan
- 1 large egg
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 to 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves
- 1/2 cup shaved Parmesan

## DIRECTIONS:

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Pierce potatoes with a fork; place potatoes onto prepared baking sheet. Place into oven and bake until tender, about 1 hour. Let cool completely.
3. Cut in half; scoop flesh into a medium bowl and mash. Transfer 1 1/2 cups to a large bowl; stir in ricotta, Parmesan, egg, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Add flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms, being careful not to over-knead.
4. Working on a lightly floured surface, divide dough into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 20-inch long rope, about 1-inch in diameter, sprinkling with additional flour as needed to prevent sticking. Using a sharp knife, cut each rope into 3/4-inch bite-size pieces; transfer to baking sheet.
5. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; working in 3 batches, cook gnocchi until tender, stirring occasionally, about 4-6 minutes. Drain well and transfer to clean rimmed baking sheet.
6. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add gnocchi and cook until golden brown and crisp, flipping once, about 2-3 minutes per side; set aside.
7. Melt butter in the skillet over low heat, 1 tablespoon at a time, until butter starts to foam. Add garlic and sage, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in gnocchi and sprinkle with Parmesan.
8. Serve immediately.
