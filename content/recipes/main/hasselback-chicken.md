## Ingredients

for 2 servings

- ¼ cup fresh spinach
- ¼ cup ricotta cheese
- 2 chicken breasts
- ¼ cup cheddar cheese
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- salt, to taste
- pepper, to taste

## Preparation

1. Cook the spinach on a medium heat in a splash of oil for 3-5 minutes until it is slightly wilted.
2. Stir in the ricotta and cook for a further 30-60 seconds. Allow to cool.
3. Cut slits into the chicken breasts about 1cm (½ inch) apart but don’t cut all the way through - about 75% of the way down is what you should aim for.
4. Stuff all of the spinach and ricotta mixture into the slits.
5. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.
6. Grate the cheddar and sprinkle it generously on top.
7. Shake the ground paprika over the chicken to add some colour and flavour.
8. Bake in the centre of a pre-heated oven for 20-25 minutes 400°F (200°C) until the cheese has melted and the juices are clear.
9. Enjoy!
