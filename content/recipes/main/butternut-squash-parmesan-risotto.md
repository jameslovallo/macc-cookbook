**Butternut Squash Parmesan Risotto**

Ingredients 

2tbsp butter\
1/2 white onion - small dice

1/2 cup white wine - optional

1 cup long grain white rice (not minute rice) (technically you’re supposed to use Arborio rice but I never have the foresight to buy it. Regular rice works fine)

4-6 cups warm chicken broth (or veggie if making it vegetarian)

1 package frozen butternut squash: steamed and puréed.

1 cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese (more or less to taste)

Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:

1. In large pan melt butter and saute onions

2. When onions are translucent, add rice. Saute for a few minutes until rice looks shiny

3. Add wine if using, saute until liquid is gone

4. Turn heat to medium low, add 1 cup chicken broth. Cook , stirring occasionally until liquid is gone. 

5. Repeat step 4 until rice starts to look creamy, adding the butternut squash after cup 3 of broth.

6. Once rice is cooked and "creamy" (drag spoon across pan and if rice briefly holds it's shape you're good) add cheese and stir until incorporated and actually creamy

7. Season with salt and pepper to taste

8. Serve immediately, topped with chicken or meatballs if desired.
