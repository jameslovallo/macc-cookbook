title: Shakshuka With Feta Recipe
description: Shakshuka may be at the apex of eggs-for-dinner recipes, though in
  Israel it is breakfast food, a bright, spicy start to the day with a pile of
  pita or challah served on the side (It also makes excellent brunch or lunch
  food.) Itâ€™s a one-skillet recipe of eggs baked in a tomato-red pepper sauce
  spiced with cumin, paprika and cayenne First you make that sauce, which comes
  together fairly quickly on top of the stove, then you gently crack each of the
  eggs into the pan, nestling them into the sauce

## Notes

We love this recipe! Be careful not to stir in the feta. If you stir too much, it will mix in with the sauce. You want the feta to sit and cook into little lumps of joy.
