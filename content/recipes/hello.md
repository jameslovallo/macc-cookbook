## Cornbread Ingredients

* **All purpose flour:** All purpose flour will allow the bread to rise a bit and give it the spongy, caky consistency of bread.
* **Yellow cornmeal:** A must for cornbread! It give the bread its beautiful golden-brown color and the grainy, delicious consistency.
* **Granulated sugar:** This gives the bread a touch of sweetness it needs to balance out the corn and bread flavors.
* **Salt:** Just a pinch to bring out the complexity of flavors.
* **Baking powder:** To help the dough rise and expand as it bakes.
* **Butter:** This is a must — it gives the bread a moist, flaky, rich flavor that is heavenly.
* **Egg:** This binds everything together and helps the bread to rise.
* **Milk:** For a rich, moist cornbread!

## How to Make Cornbread

Okay, now let’s get to the subject of this post: how to make homemade cornbread! You may be surprised to discover that baking a perfect pan of cornbread only requires a few easy steps:

1. Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or cast iron skillet well and set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2. In a medium mixing bowl, add the flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Whisk to combine well.
3. Make a well in the center of your dry ingredients and add your oil or butter, milk, and egg. Stir just until the mixture comes together and there are only a few lumps remaining.
4. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 20-25 minutes until the top is a deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
5. Serve hot.

See! It’s that easy. I love a side that comes together in a snap and is on the table in about 30 minutes.
